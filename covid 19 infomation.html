Our community of boutiques, brands and customers is extremely important to us. Many of our boutique partners have had to close their physical store locations, which is having a big impact on their businesses. We are working to ensure they can keep selling to customers on Farfetch by increasing visibility of their stock, and helping them with logistics, marketing and operations through our Farfetch platform. Your continued custom is also helping these businesses – so we thank you!

Currently, we are working with our delivery partners so that if you buy from one of these boutiques or brands through Farfetch, we can still deliver your items.
